# What I have learned about git so far is that is a version control system. Here you can track, create, monitor any changes.
# add: tells git which files we would like to use to the commit command.
# commit: creates a save point but does not uploaded to the the github
# push: uploads your work to github
# Github is the website where we can share and see others people's work.
